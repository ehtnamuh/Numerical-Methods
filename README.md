# ðŸ“˜ Numerical Methods Lab â€“ Independent University, Bangladesh

This repository contains lab worksheets, assignments, and instructional material curated for the **Numerical Methods Lab** course at **Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB)** during the **Autumn 2022** semester. The course, taught by **Amin Ahsan Ali**, introduces students to computational techniques essential for solving engineering and scientific problems using numerical approaches.

I, **Samin Bin Karim**, served as a **Teaching Assistant** for this lab under the **Center for Computational and Data Sciences (CCDS)** at IUB. My contributions included designing lab exercises, developing example implementations in Python, and supporting students in understanding core numerical techniques.
