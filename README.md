Numerical Methods Lab â€“ Independent University, Bangladesh
This repository contains lab worksheets, assignments, and instructional material curated for the Numerical Methods Lab course at Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB) during the Autumn 2022 semester. The course, taught by Amin Ahsan Ali, introduces students to computational techniques essential for solving engineering and scientific problems through numerical approaches.

I, Samin Bin Karim, served as a Teaching Assistant for this lab under the Center for Computational and Data Sciences (CCDS) at IUB. My contributions include designing lab exercises, developing example implementations in Python, and supporting students in understanding core numerical techniques.

ðŸ“Œ Course Description
This lab aims to equip students with practical skills in:

Solving problems in linear algebra, nonlinear systems, interpolation, regression, numerical integration, and differential equations.

Using Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to write code to solve problems with numerical methods.

Bridging theory with implementation to solve real-world problems and lay the groundwork for advanced topics in machine learning, data science, and scientific computing.

ðŸŽ¯ Course Objectives
Use Python and NumPy to implement numerical solutions.

Solve practical problems involving regression, classification, and clustering.

Develop efficient, readable, and well-documented code.

Learn to visualize results and communicate findings effectively.
